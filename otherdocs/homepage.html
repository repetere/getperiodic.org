Everyone has a story to tell
 * We are constantly being bombarded by stories both good and bad, by our family, friends and the media. Companies spend billions of dollars every year on advertising, trying to get their stories across to us, trying to influence us to purchase their products.
 * In the past, it's been extremely easy to comprehend the form in which stories were told, in print, in audio/visual media.
 * For better of worse, the art of story telling has evolved, individuals broadcast their personal narvatives from super computers in their pocket.
 *
But What kind of story are you telling
 * Regardgless of how the story is told, the effectiveness is judged by it's ability to communicate
  * Writing has given mankind a much greater ability to communicate more accurately and preserve the stories and ideas of the previous generations.
 * Words are mental pictures we have learned to associate in our imagination with specific things and ideas, either by vocal sounds, writing, or signs (hand). They are one of mankindâ€™s most vital tools.

	 * For thousands of years following mankind's transformation people had only the spoken word to rely on for their communication. Ancient prehistoric drawings and paintings of animals, people and symbols were also early forms of communicating. This type of communicating evolved into pictographs and later ideographs such as the Egyptian hieroglyphics. Finally around five thousand years ago the Sumerian tribes in southern Mesopotamia developed the first primitive phonetic writing called cuneiform. It marked the end of prehistory and the beginning of recorded history. The idea of placing marks on a clay tablet that could be associated with specific ideas was a giant imaginative step in mankind's intellectual progress.
